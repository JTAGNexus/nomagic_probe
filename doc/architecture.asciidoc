Firmware architecture
=====================
:toc:

This document should help the reader to get a better understanding of the nomagic_probe fimrware. It shall explain the reasoning behind the design descisions and give an overview about the major parts that together make up the nomagic_probe firmware.

== guiding principles

The guiding strategies explain the strategy of the firmware. It is also these guedlines that differentiatiate nomagic_probe from alternative solutions.

=== no magic black box

No solution can be perfect in all circumstances. The consequence of these simple truth is to either specialize on a very narrow field of application, or to accept the presence of issues. If one accept the presence of issues then one should also make it easy for the user to identify the issues, work aourond them or fix them. This way the firmware can still be of use and might even become better over time with increaed use.

If a firmware relies on magic black boxes, that contain functionality and that are expected to just work, can be very efficient. But it also makes it impossible to fix issues caused by or that arrise from these black boxes.

The nomagic_probe firmware tries to be as pefect as it can be. It also tries to be easy to understand for users that want to look "under the hood". And it avoids using magic black boxes as hard as it can.

=== focused on one target only

Soem people think that adding more and more features on a firmware just make it better and better. But every new feature comes with some hidden cost. Over time the complexity of the firmware rises and rises with each new feature until it becomes unmanageable.

To be able to include as many useful functions as possible nomagic_probe firmware will focus on supporting only one taget at a time. If the user wants to use nomagic_probe firmware with a different target chip then a change in configuration will be necesary.

=== easy configuration management

When bringing new members into a project or when going back to a project finished long ago there is a learning curve and setup cost to get the environment set up. The nomagic_probe firmware tries to decrease the burden in this sitiuation.

The recommendation is to add the frimware (*.elf or *.uf2 file) a well as any necessary target configuration files to the project source code repository. This way the setup for debugging is a two step procedure. First flashing the nomagic_probe firmware and then applying the configuration.


== applied methods
the following sections describe the methods used to achive the targets. 

=== filesystem

To allow a user configuration using configuration files the nomagic probe has a file system that can store these files.
The file sytem can be accessed using the USB interface (Mass Storage Device Class) and inside the firmware.


== structure

This chapter describes the structure of the component that make up the firmware, as well as their interactions.

These are the modules that make up the firmware:
- swd
- target
- gdbserver
- file system

The swd module provides the functionality of the SWD Interface (defined in probe_api/swd.h) to the target module.

The target module executes the functionality requested by the gdbserver module.

The gdbserver module implements the GDB-Server protocoll and uses the target module to aquire the requested information and to execute the commanded actions.

The file system provides the mass storage interface.

=== SWD

The SWD module implements the ARM specified two wire debug protocol. It does this in a layered approach.

==== bit layer
The first and lowest layer is the bit layer. It is implemented in swd_gpio.c and deals with the SWDIO and SWCLK signals. It handles the single bits on the wires. So high, Low Input Output,..

==== packet layer
The second layer is the packet layer it sits on top of the bit layer. It is implemented in swd_packets.c  and handles packets. It knows how SWD packets lok like and sends the requested packets over the line. It does this asynchronous to the API function being called in the tick function. It uses a queue. The API call enters the request for a packet to be send into the queue. In the tick call the queu is checked and if it contains a request then one packet will be send. This process makes it necessary to collect the result of a read packet from a result queue.

==== protocol layer
On top of the packet layer is the protocol layer. It is implemented in swd_protocol.c and swd_engine.c. It provides an API(defined in probe_api/swd.h) for other modules (mainly the target module) to use. It also put the requested actions into a queue and executes them once the tick function gets called. 

=== Target

The target module implements the interface to exactly one chip.

=== GDB Server

The gdbserver module implements the remote protocoll as specified for GDB.

=== file system

The file system module provides the USB Mass Storage device as well as the real and faked files inside it.

== folders
The following lists all the folders and gives an overview what they contain.

=== src
main folder.

=== src/cfg
header files that configure parts of the nomagic probe firmware.

=== src/cli
command line interface for debugging the nomagic probe firmware.

=== src/file
file system.

=== src/gdbserver
implementation of the gdb server protocol.

=== src/hal
drivers to use the peripherals of the micro controller

=== src/hal/hw
definition of the special function registers for all peripherals.

=== src/lib
implementation of functionality usually provided by a "standard library". printf(), strlen(), atoi(), memcpy(),...

=== src/swd
implementation of the ARM SWD debug interface.

=== src/tinyusb
configuration and interface to TinyUSB

=== src/tinyusb/src
the TinyUSB stack. The folder contains all files from TinyUSB. Only a small fraction of the files are actually used in this firmware. Having them all available helps if the functionality needs to be extended and with tinyUS updates.

=== doc
contains documenation in various formats for all functionality of the nomagic probe.

=== res
general ressource files that were used.

=== tests
unit tests.

=== tools
software tools than were used.


== files

=== main
The main function. In dual core mode splitting the tasks onto the core is done here.


=== led
blinks the led in a pattern. This is used to signal different firmware states by using different blink patterns.
