== protocol definition

An operation on the wire consists of two or three phases:
  * Packet request
  * Acknowledge response
  * Data transfer phase

When the target samples SWDIO, sampling is performed on the rising edge of SWCLK. When the target drives
SWDIO, or stops driving it, signal changes are performed on the rising edge of SWCLK.

Target has a 100k pull up on SWDIO.


== SWD protocol versions
  * 1 : point-to-point
  * 2 : multi-drop

== Data transfer phase


=== Idle cycles
Hochst clocks SWD interface with the line LOW.

=== Bit Order
LSB first!
For example, the OK response of 0b001 appears on the wire as 1, followed by 0, followed by 0, as shown in

=== Parity
Even parity!

==== Packet requests
The parity check is made over the four bits APnDP, RnW and A[2:3]:
  * If the number of bits with a value of 0b1 is odd, the parity bit is set to 0b1.
  * If the number of bits with a value of 0b1 is even, the parity bit is set to 0b0.

==== Data transfers (WDATA and RDATA)
The parity check is made over the 32 data bits WDATA[0:31] or RDATA[0:31]:
  * If the number of bits with a value of 0b1 is odd, the parity bit is set to 0b1.
  * If the number of bits with a value of 0b1 is even, the parity bit is set to 0b0.

== Dictionary

There are some SWD specific words used that only make sense in the SWD contet. These words are defined here.
